Keyzcar Java release 0.71b
==========================

2011-11-02  Shawn Willden  <swillden@google.com>

	* Omit '"padding"="OAEP"' from RSA key files that use the default
	padding.  Adding the padding field breaks the current Python
	code.
	* Added this ChangeLog so we can more easily document what changes
	from releast to release.  Will also begin tagging each release in
	git.

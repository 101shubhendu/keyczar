# This is a multi-line usage message
# The output looks like the following when arguments are passed in:
#Usage: "KeyczarTool command flags"
#Commands: create addkey pubkey promote demote revoke
#Flags: location name size status purpose destination version asymmetric crypter
#Command Usage:
#create --location=/path/to/keys --purpose=(crypt|sign) [--name="A name"] [--asymmetric=(dsa|rsa)]
#	Creates a new, empty key set in the given location.
#	This key set must have a purpose of either "crypt" or "sign"
#	and may optionally be given a name. The optional asymmetric 
#	flag will generate a public key set of the given algorithm.
#	The "dsa" asymmetric value is valid only for sets with "sign" purpose.
#	with the given purpose.
#addkey --location=/path/to/keys [--status=(active|primary)] [--size=size] [--crypter=crypterLocation]
#	Adds a new key to an existing key set. Optionally
#	specify a status, which is active by default. Optionally
#	specify a key size in bits. Also optionally specify the
#	location of a set of crypting keys, which will be used to
#	encrypt this key set.
#pubkey --location=/path/to/keys --destination=/destination
#	Extracts public keys from a given key set and writes them
#	to the destination. The "pubkey" command Only works for
#	key sets that were created with the "--asymmetric" flag.
#promote --location=/path/to/keys --version=versionNumber
#	Promotes the status of the given key version in the given 
#	location. Active keys are promoted to primary (which demotes 
#	any existing primary key to active). Keys scheduled for 
#	revocation are promoted to be active.
#demote --location=/path/to/keys --version=versionNumber
#	Demotes the status of the given key version in the given
#	location. Primary keys are demoted to active. Active keys
#	are scheduled for revocation.
#revoke --location=/path/to/keys --version=versionNumber
#	Revokes the key of the given version number.
#	This key must have been scheduled for revocation by the
#demote command. WARNING: The key will be destroyed.
#
#Optional flags are in [brackets]. The notation (a|b|c) means "a", "b", and "c"
#are the valid choices

\tPromotes the status of the given key version in the given \n\
